## Practice 4

#### Improve the previous k-means clustering ([practice #3](https://github.com/SitiBanc/1061_NCTU_IOMDS/blob/master/1018/Course%20Material/1018_2.py))

* Apply standard score normalization or scaling normalization to each feature space
* Calculate the sum of with-in class difference
* Repeat the k-means algorithm for several times to find the best solution which has the smallest sum of with-in class difference

## Practice 5

#### Calculate the confusion matrix of IRIS prediction from 1-NN to 10-NN
